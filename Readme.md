# US Public Food Assistance 1 - WIC
Where does it come from, who spends it, who gets it.

## About Dataset

`Context`
=> This dataset, addresses another US program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children Program, or simply WIC.
=> The program allocates Federal and State funds to help low-income women and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk.
=> Funds are used to provide supplemental foods, baby formula, health care, and nutrition education.

`Content`
--> Files may include participation data and spending for state programs, and poverty data for each state.
--> Data for WIC covers fiscal years 2013, which is actually October 2012 through September 2013.

`Motivation`
My original purpose here is two-fold:

1. Explore various aspects of US Public Assistance.
2. Show trends over recent years and better understand differences across state agencies.
3. Although the federal government sponsors the program and provides funding, program are administered at the state level and can widely vary.
4. Indian nations (native Americans) also administer their own programs.
